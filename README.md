# Budget Planner

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Start the app with `npm start`

## About it
This project was made to analize some differences and benefits of using components with `props` and the transformation with `context hook`.

We used tags from git to show you the approaches and evolution of the project, so you can navigate easily through it.

You can use `git tag [Tag version]` to see the changes

### Tag Versions:

`01` - Simple HTML splitted in many components

`02` - Functional form with values ready to be added

`03` - Passing `props` into components to add expenses and see the total budget

`04` - Use of `useContext hook` as first approach to get expenses and budget

`05` - Refactor the context within a single file with `reducers and state management`

`06` - Refactor the context by splitting `reducers and states`
